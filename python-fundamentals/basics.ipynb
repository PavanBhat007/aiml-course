    "1. **Primitive Data Types**: Integer (`int`), Floating Point (`float`), Boolean (`bool`) and String (`str`) are primitive data types\n",
    "  - The variables of these data types represent a single value only \n",
    "  - They are immutable => once created, their values cannot be changed _\"in-place\"_ i.e., any operation that seems to modify them actually _**creates a new object/instance**_ instead.\n",
    "  - Lesser memory as they are simple data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-Primitive Data Types**: List (`list`), Dictionary (`dict`), Tuple (`tuple`) and Sets (`set`) are non-primitive data types.\n",
    "  - The variables of these data types represent multiple values.\n",
    "  - They are mutable => can be modified _\"in-place\"_ and copying creates _\"shallow/deep\"_ copies and not create new instances.\n",
    "  - Take up more memory as they store complex data."
